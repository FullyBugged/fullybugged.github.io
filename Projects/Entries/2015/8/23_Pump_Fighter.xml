    <richText>Pump Fighter is a simple 2 player game made for fun.&#xD;&#xD;Find a human friend or enemy, Choose a side, and Tap the screen the fastest you can to explode the head of your opponent!&#xD;Originally created in 18 hours on MsDos during a Demo party / Game Jam back in 1998, we decided to port it to Android to have fun with our friends and family! Done in our spare time, re-using the assets from back then with few improvements here and there, it took us a cumulated time of around 18h again to call it ready to be published!&#xD;&#xD;Completely Free, with no Ads, we're happy to offer you this small game!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fullybuggedsoftware.pumpfighter.fantasyland"&gt;Availabe now on Google play&lt;/a&gt;</richText>
